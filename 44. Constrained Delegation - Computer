Kerberos constrained delegation was introduced in Windows Server 2003 to provide a safer form of delegation that could be used by services. 
When it is configured, constrained delegation restricts the services to which the specified server can act on the behalf of a user. 
This requires domain administrator privileges to configure a domain account for a service and is restricts the account to a single domain. 
In today's enterprise, front-end services are not designed to be limited to integration with only services in their domain.
